# Pfizer Vaccination Sentiment Analysis

Welcome to the Pfizer Vaccination Sentiment Analysis project! This repository showcases a data science project that focuses on analyzing sentiment in Pfizer vaccination-related social media posts and comments.

## Overview

Understanding public sentiment regarding the Pfizer vaccination is crucial in the context of its widespread use. This project utilizes Python, data science techniques, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to determine whether people express positive or negative sentiments in their online comments and tweets related to Pfizer vaccinations.

Here's a brief overview of what the project accomplishes:

- **Sentiment Analysis:** The project uses NLP and machine learning to classify text data into positive or negative sentiment categories, providing insights into public sentiment.

- **Data Source:** The dataset includes social media posts, comments, and tweets related to Pfizer vaccinations, collected from various sources.

- **Visualization:** The code generates WordClouds to visualize frequently used words in reviews and tweets, offering a quick snapshot of key terms.

## Key Libraries Used

- **TextBlob:** TextBlob is employed for natural language processing and sentiment analysis.

- **Scikit-learn (Sklearn):** Sklearn is used to build sentiment classification models for analyzing the sentiment of comments and tweets.

- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** NLTK provides additional language processing capabilities and aids in text preprocessing.
